%An introduction/motivation section, in which you explain why the problem you are about to address is interesting and challenging
%A section describing the basic approach that you will take. You should assume that algorithms we discuss in class (e.g. SVMs, HMMs etc.) are known, but summarize any algorithms that would not have been discussed in class (e.g. conditional random fields, multi-dimensional scaling etc.)
%A section describing the experimental setup. Here you describe your data set, along with any pre-processing steps that you might have taken (e.g. to remove noise, select attributes etc.). You should describe this in enough detail that someone with access to your data could exactly reproduce the results
%A section describing your results, along with a discussion of what you observed. It is important to ensure that you perform your experiments in such a way that results are meaningful (e.g., make sure you use cross-validation and report test set results). If you use statistical testing to assess the significance of your results, make sure that the test you choose is appropriate for your data. If appropriate, report running time in addition to performance.
%A section containing conclusions and possible future work directions.
%A section of references
%An Appendix in PPT format in a form of a short tutorial surveying the subject of the project.
